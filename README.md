# Social Media API

## Motivation

This project was motivated by the need to create a robust and scalable social media API that can handle complex data relationships.

## Why This Was Built

This was built to provide a backend solution for social media applications, handling operations related to users, thoughts, and reactions.

## What It Solved

This project solved the challenge of managing and manipulating complex data in a social media context, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to use Express.js for routing, Mongoose for data modeling, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database.
